                <p>
                    &nbsp; Hello, I’m Kiera Kushnerus, a multifaceted enthusiast with a
                    profound love for the arts. Whether I’m belting out tunes as a
                    singer or playing glistening glissandos with my clarinet, music has
                    always been an important part of my life and I play in my school’s
                    top band and I am the most experienced singer in my choir.
                    My journey also extends into the world of visual art, where I’m
                    dedicated to honing my skills, continually seeking avenues for
                    creative growth. Just in the past year I have made great strides
                    in my artistic abilities and hope to see further growth in the future.

                    &nbsp; Beyond the realm of arts, I’m captivated by the digital landscape.
                    Excitingly, I’m gearing up for an adventure at Miami University,
                    where I’ll immerse myself in the intricate craft of video game
                    development. This passion converges with my commitment to
                    academic
                    excellence, as I navigate college-level computer science courses.
                    I believe strongly that computer science skills are integral to not
                    only my future as a game designer but also the world at large.

                    &nbsp; What sparked my interest in video game design was naturally an
                    interest in playing video games themselves. I believe video games
                    are the pinnacle of creative works. Every one of my interests feeds
                    into video games in a major way. All weaved together to create
                    something full of passion. I once got the opportunity to playtest
                    up and coming indie games in my area and I truly felt in my element.
                    The people there had a strong dedication to their craft that I
                    greatly admired. I hope that one day I can count myself among
                    them and create something worthy of their and the wider public’s care.
