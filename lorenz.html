        <p> &nbsp;Lorenz is a character from Fire Emblem Three Houses.
            He is also my favorite character. Lorenz has a deeply interesting
            story that made me like him as soon as I started playing the game.

        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;He was someone who grew up in the lap of luxury
            as a powerful noble. He was being groomed to be the
            head of the oligarchical country he inhabited before
            that chance was stolen from him by a nobody of
            dubious origin. Lorenz has to grapple with this
            new future while also interacting with commoners
            and learning to respect them as equals to learn
            how to best lead them and improve their lives once
            he becomes head of House Gloucester.

            &nbsp;Lorenz always puts his foot in his mouth even
            though he means well. His general social skills
            are lacking though he is completely unaware of
            that. This causes him to frequently offend people
            and leave them with the impression that he is a
            self important snob that only cares about those
            of noble status.

            "Soon after the war, Lorenz assumed leadership over House Gloucester and helped govern FÃ³dlan as a
            representative of the old Alliance lords. His political talent yielded revolutionary policy changes, many of
            which were of particular benefit to the commonfolk."
